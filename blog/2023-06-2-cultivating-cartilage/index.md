Now it’s been a while since I did the initial research for myself, however I did a recent dive back into the interwebs as I’ve had a couple friends talking to me about knee pain lately. Having had regular knee pain since I was pretty young, I’m quite familiar with this symptom and I’m so grateful that it’s not as common an occurrence these days, though that requires forever upkeep after the initial hard work.

First; stopping the inflammation and erosion. Not super helpful to try to build cartilage while the body is still attacking itself and eroding the cartilage in between your joints… You can do this with foods; by both eliminating some, and focusing on getting others in.

You want to be eating:

- Legumes; Protein & Lysine
- Dark Leafy Greens; Anitoxidants, Vit K, magnesium, calcium, & iron
- Snackies you ask?; Pomegranates, blueberries, oranges?, plums, nuts, seeds,
- Turmeric (Curcumin) & Ginger. Don’t need to be taken together, but check it out in Supplements. You can also find these together in teas!
- Green tea; polyphenols & catachins (protect and restore cartilage)
- Fish, especially the little & super oily ones!
- Bone broth (If you are not vegetarian and can find organic beef bones to make bone broth, there are a million recipes for this online everywhere or buying the stuff straight, or in powder format from a bigger health food store)

Oils: Olive & coconut (in foods and applied on the skin with the below essential oils):

- Lavender
- Helychrysum
- Mint & Eucalyptus
- Rosemary, lemongrass, & ginger

Supplements / Vitamins:

- Glucosamine
- Chrondroitin Sulfate (not vegan)
- Lysine (Amino Acid)
- Hyaluronic Acid
- Magnesium (supports absorption of H.Acid)
- Vitamin K (supports absorption of Omega)
- Vitamin D
- Vitamin C
- Calcium
- Antioxidants
- Polyphenols
- Omegas (hard to find vegan, but in seaweed / algae, flax, chia, and walnuts there’s a bunch)
- Boswellia / Frankincense
- Icariin (Horny Goat Weed) (Flavanoid & phytoestrogen extract) increases cartilage thickness
  Curcumin - preferably a blend with black pepper for better absorption and if it can have ginger, or white willow, or devil’s or cat’s claw with it too, even better! Those last 3 I use on occasion for pain, so I recommend talking to a naturopath or good doctor about trying it out for helping with pain management while you are building the muscle up especially.

You want try to eliminate:

- Sugar
- Dairy
- Gluten (or all Grains if you feel really brave or desperate)
- Nightshade vegetables (tomatoes, potatoes, etc)

Try cutting it out for a 3 months minimum trial period, and see how you feel when you reintroduce one at a time. For me Grains and dairy are the biggest triggers for arthritis, and legumes unfortunately cause an autoimmune response for me as well, so different things will have different effects for different people and you really have to get to know your own body with care and tenderness.

Low Impact Exercise. I knowww, it hurts to exercise. I really do know, and yet I also know that as much as I hated being pushed to do it so much by doctors, physio and occupational therapists, it worked continues to work. Whenever I stop for a while, the pain gets worse, and everytime, it’s still hard to get back into, but time after time, I have proven to myself (despite my other parts’ best efforts) that I feel so much better when I’m consistently exercising. Sooooo what’s that look like for you?

Start with: Very light stretches while focusing on breathing and the body
A little swimming; maybe once every 2 weeks is all you can muster right now, that is alright!
Cycling - again maybe it’s 2 mins, 2/week to start out!
Progressive Muscle relaxation - tighten the muscles for 8 seconds with an inhale & release with an exhale for another 8 seconds (or whatever time feels good)

Slowly increase, and make time to take care of yourself after. I’ll talk more about that later, but it’s important to making this sustainable enough to actually note a difference. This process has taken me years to stabilize where I am now. This capacity seemed impossible 5 years ago, but with time, patience, and persistence, I’m here and I’m continuing to push the boundaries with love, of what I am capable of.

Maybe you’re fairly able bodied and the pain is not so intense that you are limping or limiting your excursions. Do some squats! Focus on quality over quantity and aim for getting into the rhythm of doing 3 reps of 10, every morning or 5 out of 7mornings / week (maybe start with 1 or 2 mornings / week). Maybe you’ll manage this one day and then realize the pain is too sore, please start slow and verrryyyyyyy slowly increase only one segment at a time! Check out our post on getting some exercise with chronic pain for more around this if you struggle with not having capacities for other things after exercising.

Focus on how you feel before, during and after. Give ratings and record the shifts if it helps! I know I was reluctant to believe exercise was actually helping in the long term while causing so much more pain in the short term, but it did. It continues to be a thing my body needs to have enough energy to function and to keep the pain levels down in my joints (not even mentioning the mental health improvements).

And soooooo, cultivating cartilage! We can also cultivate more cartilage growth by imagining it to be so. Literally sit still, get into a relaxed state (yes, this is scientifically linked with improving inflammation levels as your parasympathic is system being activated, and it all works together, I promise). Visualize your knees being surrounding by a healing light, or little doves or fairies or sparkles covering your joints and calming all the inflammation, and growing the cartilage in these areas. There are some great youtube videos around this; you might want to check out Dr. Joe Dispenza’s work.

Side missions:
Heal your gut! I can write a whole little book on this but healing your gut will help so many things and there’s already plenty of books out there explaining why and how these doctors think you can do it. My personal version was a variation on Dr. Gundry’s work, along several bits I had already been trying before, like cutting out sugar, dairy, gluten, caffeine, and alcohol (on my already vegetarian eating habits). For me, Grains and Dairy especially inflame my joints, and I would only have been able to determine this by doing the FODMAP diet, with a modification that I could tolerate, which took a lot longer, but done is better than perfect, and so learning to actually shift my diet to be grain, dairy, sugar, legumes, nightshades, and as much as possible, totally lectin free, really worked for me. My gastrointestinal issues, skin issues all cleared up and remain cleared so long as I don’t consume any amounts of the things I have learned that trigger me. Finding a good probiotic is also super helpful! On this diet it can be tough, but a good variety of gut flora can be supported with Vegan kefir, & Sauerkraut.

You can detox lightly with lemon water every morning on an empty stomach (preferably 30mins - an hour before breakfast) so it has time to work through your gut, intestines, kidney, & liver, and get those stomach acids ready to digest the food well and sending those signals to the brain that it is ready!

Get good sleep. The things that we all know help our bodies heal, regenerate and restore, can sometimes be so hard to consistently do… You already know you should drink some more water while you're at it! (:

Practice gratitude & pride. This one has been really hard for me, especially the first few years, but it has also proven time and time again to be worthwhile and bring improvements in mental and physical health. So, maybe try thinking of something you are grateful for and proud of each night before going to sleep. Make it part of your routine (along with stretches or whatever little movement is a step forward for you).

You can do this! The pain doesn’t have to win everytime, and doing this doesn’t have to mean pushing yourself and ignoring your body. It can be;
Doing some deep breathing and just visualizing the knees healing
A guided body scan (check out our events as we offer these regularly).
Anticipating the possibility of pain or discomfort. You know this is going to likely hurt, at the beginning (few days or months or perhaps years), and it is still worth it.
It can help to keep envisioning what you want to be able to do. Whether that’s walking through the house or outside without mobility aids (even just some times), or being able to rock climb, or pick up a child, or travel (alone even!), play basketball, or care for a furry friend, really imagine yourself doing the thing (or all of them), and keep it as motivation, while you go slowly and listen to your body. For me, these things all seemed impossible at one point and I am beyond grateful I have been able to accomplish every single one since then.

This takes time, and therefore patience, stamina, and resilience. You are not alone on this journey, and please feel free to reach out to our online community for support through this time! Feel free to join (no cost and super secure) the discord channel for support amongst others who deal with this and are working on managing pain and improving capacities. https://discord.gg/c7A6GENCBc

Track your progress! I know the act of recording symptoms feels too time consuming and not very helpful but when I looked back after 8 months or a year of recording data like what I ate, exercised and pain and energy levels, the evidence was clear that it was working, so I had to keep going.

Self-care & Pain Management:

- TENS machine post movement
- Pain cream, maybe a CBD one, more importantly with menthol, and frankincense (some eucalyptus and Lavender also really help) to really help the inflammation and pain you can anticipate experiencing when increasing exercise.
- Gentle Massage
- Epsom Salt Bath
- Magnesium Malate (couple hours before bed)
- Foot massages at bedtime (think Chinese medicine & reflexology if you’d like)

I love my knees, and I’m so greatful for all the wonderful things they allow me to do now. I’m so greatful they communicate with me and give me so many warnings before giving out so I can take care of them, and the rest of me like I’m supposed to do. Love your knees (all the joints, and eventually, hopefully, all the things), appreciate what they can do for you, and you’ll start to see more of it too. Sending love and healing as always.
