If you know the Portuguese saying, 'passar de bestial a besta', you know it highlights how quickly things can change to the exact opposite. From a portuguese perspective of course, focusing on the things going wrong when previously they were considered great. It's the 'fado' in us. We can't escape it.

But of course the opposite route is possible as well, and here's one example where in Portugal something that was considered an accommodation for a  person with a disability’s aid, and frowned upon when used by anyone else, now seems to be a status symbol. 
Automatic shift cars were impossible to find in the eighties in Portugal and had to be custom ordered for disabled people. I remember my dad had a work colleague that had to walk with canes, he had a prosthetic leg now that I think of it, and he spent years ordering his car. When it finally came, I was mesmerised by it because... How did it not have the shift thingy!!!? 
Now, take into account the cultural environment back then... These cars were of course impossible to resell, because anyone who had them was either in need of them because of a disability or because they had to have some kind of difficulty driving. 
This mentality is what resisted the incoming of automatic shift cars even in the 2010s. I remember wanting one by 2014/2015 and everybody asking me why! Did I not know how to clutch point?? Was I lazy? Certainly (and I love this one), I must not enjoy driving!! 
The gaping lack of a shift stick in the middle was a sure sign of a disabled person's car. 
I bought an automatic back then and have continued to do so after I sold that initial car. Regardless of what everyone thought about it, it made my life so much easier with the 3 hour commute /day I had to endure, on the busiest roads in Lisbon. Plus, a free hand (omg!) especially when you have kids is like... A requirement. 
So how surprised am I that now, not only has this been normalised, but now, it's even considered a 'luxury' of sorts, like something more 'evolved' affluent people choose. 
Talk about being ahead of the times. I mean, I remember people telling me they couldn't drive my car if they had to... I also remember having a friend of mine try to drive my car and being the most shaken up I've ever been in my whole life for all the back and forth movements while she tried to drive it. It was almost like going on a roller coaster ride... but not so fun. 
And now I am watching even my most conservative friend talking about how smooth and easy his travels are now that he drives automatic when back then he argued how wrong an automatic shift car was when I tried to buy one. Him now obsessed about his new car being of course, an automatic car.
So here's a story about how it is possible to change a mindset for the better. But more so, how an adaptation for an accommodation of a need is now a luxury want. If it’s supposed to be essential aid to make an everyday tool accessible then why is it being priced as a luxury item where those who need it the most can’t access it. Wouldn't it be wonderful to make something needed easily accessible for those who need it and allow for everyone else to benefit from the adaptation as well? The more we take into consideration adaptability needs the easier we make things for all of us.
